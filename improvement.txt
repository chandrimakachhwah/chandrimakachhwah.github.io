Website Review Report: Chandrima Kachhwah Portfolio
I've completed a comprehensive review of the website. Here's my detailed report:
Overview
The website is a Jekyll-based portfolio using the Minimal Mistakes theme (version 4.24.0) with the "default" skin. It's hosted on GitHub Pages and serves as a professional portfolio for a VLSI Analog Design Engineer.chandrimakachhwah.github+1

🎨 Theme Issues
1. Theme Skin Selection
Current: Using "default" skin which provides a neutral gray color scheme[github]​


Issue: The default skin feels generic and doesn't strongly reflect personal branding


Recommendation: use mint theme
2. Hero Section Background
Current: Dark blue/navy hero section (#3f4f75 approximately)[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


Issue: The color doesn't match the default theme's color palette, creating slight visual disconnect


Positive: The hero section does create good visual hierarchy and contrast


3. Custom CSS Organization
Current: Has custom CSS for project feature boxes, icon colors, and button spacing[github]​


Issue: Limited custom styling - mostly icon colors (#5e72e4, #4caf50, #17a2b8)


Recommendation: Expand custom CSS to create more cohesive visual identity throughout the site



🔧 Technical Issues
1. Repository Configuration
The site uses remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.24.0"[github]​


⚠️ Note: Version 4.24.0 is from 2022. Current version is 4.26.x. Consider updating for bug fixes and improvements


2. Missing Social Media Integration
Twitter/X configuration is commented out in _config.yml[github]​


Recommendation: remove the commented code


3. Missing Site Logo
og_image: /assets/images/site-logo.png is set but no visible logo on main pageschandrimakachhwah.github+1


Recommendation: Add a visible logo/profile image to the header or sidebar for better branding


4. SEO Optimization Needed
Basic SEO tags are present but could be enhanced


Recommendation: Add more detailed meta descriptions for each page



📱 Responsive Design
Positive Aspects:
Minimal Mistakes theme is inherently responsive


Navigation works well on different viewport sizes


Sidebar collapses appropriately[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


Areas for Improvement:
Hero section font size might be too large on mobile devices


Test touch targets for buttons on smaller screens (should be at least 44×44px)



🎯 Content & Layout Issues
1. Sidebar Information
Current: Left sidebar shows basic bio and social links[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


Issue: No profile photo/avatar visible


Recommendation: Add a professional headshot to make the portfolio more personal


2. Hero Section
Current: Clean layout with title and CTA buttons[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


Issue: Tagline below title is barely visible (very low opacity)


Recommendation: Increase tagline opacity to improve readability


3. Navigation
Current: Simple top navigation (About, Projects, Blog)[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


Positive: Clean and functional


Minor Issue: No visual indicator for active page in main nav


4. Footer
Current: Minimal footer with copyright and credits[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


Recommendation: Consider adding quick links, contact info, or additional social media icons



🚀 Improvement Recommendations
High Priority:
Add Profile Image: Upload and display a professional photo in the sidebar


Fix Hero Tagline Visibility: Increase opacity of the subtitle text under the main heading


Update Theme Version: Upgrade to Minimal Mistakes 4.26.x for latest improvements


Verify og_image: Ensure the social sharing image exists at the specified path


Medium Priority:
Custom Color Scheme: Define a cohesive color palette that matches your personal brand


Active Navigation State: Add visual indicators for the current page in navigation


Expand Custom CSS: Add more custom styling for:


Link hover effects


Code block styling


Blog post card designs


Consistent spacing throughout


Low Priority:
Theme Skin Exploration: Test different Minimal Mistakes skins (dark, contrast, plum) to find better fit


Typography Enhancement: Consider adding custom fonts via Google Fonts


Animations: Add subtle transitions and hover effects for better interactivity


Footer Enhancement: Add more useful links and information



✅ Positive Aspects
Clean, professional layout[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


Well-organized content structure (Home, About, Projects, Blog)


Proper use of Jekyll includes and layouts


SEO plugin configured (jekyll-seo-tag)[github]​


RSS feed available[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


Proper use of semantic HTML


Fast loading (static site)



🎨 Design Consistency Score: 7/10
The site has a solid foundation but needs more custom styling to stand out from default Minimal Mistakes installations. The technical implementation is good, but visual identity could be stronger.
Accessibility Notes
Ensure all images have alt text


Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards


Test keyboard navigation throughout


Add skip navigation links (already present - good!)[chandrimakachhwah.github]​


This portfolio has excellent bones and just needs some visual polish and customization to truly shine. The technical setup is solid, and with the recommended improvements, it will become a distinctive and memorable portfolio.
